# Exercise 1: Setup the example application

For our first exercise, we want to make sure we can run the subsequent exercises without problems.  This means ensuring we have a working app against which to test.

**Pro tip:** This is another good exercise you can do before you get to the workshop  ðŸ˜€

## Success Criteria

- Our webserver should serve the example website (VeRBO)

## Instructions

In each exercise, there is a `verbo` directory where we will run our app.

1. In your terminal, `cd` to the `exercise-1/verbo` directory
2. Install dependencies with `npm i` _(a shorter alias for `npm install`)_  
  _Two carpal tunnel surgeries and you'd want to type less, too._
3. Start the app with `npm start`
4. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000

_You should now have a working web application ready for testing in the next exercise!_
