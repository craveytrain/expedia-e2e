# Exercise 7: Personas and paths

**Before you start really ramping up your automated e2e testing, you need a strategy.**  Which means you must put some thought into which user scenarios and workflows you will implement as e2e tests, instead of a unit or integration test.

The more e2e tests you have, the longer those tests take to run, so you must have the appropriate mix of unit, integration, and e2e tests.

> The general rule is that e2e tests are most important for:
> - protecting the most common paths and workflows that your users undertake throughout the site
> - especially parts of the site directly tied to your revenue stream

_Use the following questions to help choose which user paths and interactions should be included in your automated e2e tests:_

**Identify your personas**

- What types of users use your product?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- Document these where they’ll always be highly visible

**Identify their critical paths**

- How do users move through your app to achieve their goals?
- Do your users take the same path, or are there multiple paths or scenarios that must be tested?
- Draw these out and publish them

**Identify key interactions within those paths**

- What are the most important interactions your users will have along their path?
- Which elements, if broken, prevent your users from completing their objective?
- Which elements, if broken, prevent your users from giving you money?
