# Exercise 4: Adding `mocha`

When we originally ran the `wdio` command to generate our config file, we chose `mocha` as the framework for organizing our tests.

## Success Criteria

1. Learn how to use mocha to group our tests appropriately.
2. Learn the main difference between `sync` modes
3. Add a convenient `npm` script

## Instructions

### Switch to sync mode

Back when we first created our `wdio.conf.js` file, we set `sync` mode to `false` so we could reuse some of our first test code.  It returned a promise with a `.then()` which called `assert()` to validate the test.

However, WebDriver.io can do a cool trick where we enable `sync` mode to `true`, and it will handle a lot of the _asynchronous_ nature of browser testing for us, and allow us to write more readable code that looks more _synchronous_.

You can read more about it in the official documentation, [It's all synchronous](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/v4.html#It%E2%80%99s-all-synchronous).

_An example from the WebDriver.io docs of code that looks more synchronous, without any promises:_

```js
// Notice the lack of return statements and `.then()`?
describe('webdriver.io page', function() {
    it('should have the right title', function () {
        // Navigate
        browser.url('/');

        // Get the page's title
        var title = browser.getTitle();

        // Assert the page title is what we expect it to be
        assert.equal(title, 'WebdriverIO - WebDriver bindings for Node.js');
    });
});
```

> **Important:** "All commands now block the execution of the test process until theyâ€™ve resolved. No then calls have to be done anymore, we can just assign the direct response of the Selenium server to a variable."

### Init the exercise

1. Change to the correct directory

```bash
cd tests/browser/exercise-4
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### Let's make our code look more synchronous

_Because it makes everything appear cleaner and more readable!_

1. In `wdio.conf.js`, change `sync` back to `true`:

```js
// ...
sync: true,
// ...
```

2. We need to change the code from returning a promise _(async style)_, to a handful of separate statements that will execute one after another _(sync style)_.

Open the `exercise-4/tests/browser/example.spec.js` test file, and replace it with the following code:

```js
/**
 * example.spec.js
 */
var assert = require('assert');

describe('Example', function () {
    describe('page title', function () {
        var expectedPageTitle = "Verbo - Simple travel planning";

        it('should be ' + expectedPageTitle, function () {
            /* Notice we're removing the returned Promise, and breaking each `.then()` into its own line. */

            // Navigate to the home page and test the page title
            browser.url('/');

            // Get the page title
            var pageTitle = browser.getTitle();

            // Log the page title (just for fun)
            console.log('ðŸ¤– The page title is: "' + pageTitle + '"');

            // Assert the page title is what we expect it to be
            assert.equal(pageTitle, expectedPageTitle);

            // Want to see what a failure looks like?  Uncomment the line below to try the `.not` syntax!
            // assert.notEqual(pageTitle, expectedPageTitle);
        });
    });
});
```

_Look Ma, no promises!_

3. Run it

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/wdio
```

You should see the example spec run with 1 passing test, and the page title printed to the console:

### Launch `wdio` with an `npm` script

Let's add an `npm run test:browser` script so we can avoid calling `wdio` directly, and make it easier for other developers and build tools to run your e2e test suite.

You can call your script just about anything, but at HomeAway, we typically have a pattern where a variety of "sub-scripts" use the colons to group similar scripts _(`:`)_.

Also, `npm run test` is more typically used to run unit tests.

1. Open `package.json`
2. Notice the new `scripts` field:

```js
"scripts": {
    "test:browser": "wdio"
},
```

3. Now, simply run `npm run test:browser` from now on to run your suite of tests.  Notice the `> wdio` in the output:

![Running npm run test:browser](https://content.screencast.com/users/gnorwood_homeaway/folders/Snagit/media/6e5f3aec-80d0-4112-8e52-1c41bdad2070/2018-05-28_00-38-17.png)

**Pro tip:** Another benefit to using `npm` scripts is that they already search `node_modules/.bin` for local executables, so we can simple execute `wdio` without the rest of the path.

## What we learned

1. We learned how to use mocha syntax to group our tests with `describe()` and `it()` functions.
2. We learned that setting `sync` mode to `true` allows us to write more simple, synchronous-looking code in our tests, and let WebDriver.io extract away the inherently async behavior of testing with web browsers.
3. We created an `npm run test:browser` script that will make running `wdio` easier in the future.
