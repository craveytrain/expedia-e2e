# Exercise 4: Adding `mocha`

When we originally ran the `wdio` command to generate our config file, we chose `mocha` as the framework for organizing our tests.

## Success Criteria

1. Learn how to use mocha to group our tests appropriately.

## Instructions

### Switch to sync mode

Back when we first created our `wdio.conf.js` file, we set `sync` mode to `false` so we could reuse some of our first test code.  It returned a promise with a `.then()` which called `assert()` to validate the test.

However, WebDriver.io can do a cool trick where we enable `sync` mode to `true`, and it will handle a lot of the _asynchronous_ nature of browser testing for us, and allow us to write more readable code that looks more _synchronous_.

You can read more about it in the official documentation, [It's all synchronous](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/v4.html#It%E2%80%99s-all-synchronous).

_Example of more synchronous code in "sync mode", without any promises:_

```js
describe('webdriver.io page', function() {
    it('should have the right title', function () {
        browser.url('/');
        var title = browser.getTitle();
        assert.equal(title, 'WebdriverIO - WebDriver bindings for Node.js');
    });
});
```

> "All commands now block the execution of the test process until theyâ€™ve resolved. No then calls have to be done anymore, we can just assign the direct response of the Selenium server to a variable."

1. In `wdio.conf.js`, change `sync` back to `true`:

```js
// ...
sync: true,
// ...
```

1. In our `example.spec.js` test file, we need to change the code from returning a promise _(async style)_, to a handful of separate statements that will execute one after another (sync).

```js
// example.spec.js
var assert = require('assert');

describe('Example', function() {
  describe('page title', function() {

    var expectedPageTitle = "Verbo - Simple travel planning";

    it('should be ' + expectedPageTitle, function() {

        /* Notice we're removing the returned Promise, and breaking each `.then()` into its own line. */

        // Navigate to the home page and test the page title
        browser.url('/');

        // Get the page title
        var pageTitle = browser.getTitle();
        assert.equal(title, expectedPageTitle);
    });

  });
});
```
