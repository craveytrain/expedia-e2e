/**
* TODO: We need to change the code from returning a promise _(async style)_, to a
*       handful of separate statements that will execute one after another _(sync style)_.
*
*       - Copy the new "sync" code example from the README for Exercise 4, replacing this file entirely.
*       - Notice how the test will still validate your page title in a similar way, but with a friendlier syntax.
