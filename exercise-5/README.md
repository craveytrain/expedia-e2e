## Success criteria

1. Practice accessing different elements on the page with CSS-style selectors.
2. Learn more about the available commands.

## Instructions

For simplicity, I've already copied the solution from the previous exercise into `exercise-5/tests/browser/homepage.spec.js`, so we'll start from there.  The `homepage.spec.js` file will contain all our homepage tests.

### Using selectors to interact with browser elements

WebDriver.io uses CSS-style selectors to access elements in the browser's DOM.  [Learn more about selectors](http://webdriver.io/guide/usage/selectors.html)

#### ðŸ’ª Challenge 1: The navbar

Write two tests in the stubbed out `it()` blocks in `homepage.spec.js`.

- `it('should render the correct app name')`
- `it('should render a "My Profile" link')`

Use the `browser` object and Chai's `expect()` function as we did in the previous exercises as a starting point.  You can copy/pasta, if you like - it'll save you time!

_to-do:_

- [ ] Create solution

#### ðŸ’ª Challenge 2: Travel alerts

Write two tests in the stubbed out `it()` blocks in `homepage.spec.js`.

- `it('should render the correct count of travel alerts in the navbar badge')`
- `it('should render the correct count of travel alerts in the homepage widget')`

_to-do:_

- [ ] Create solution

âœ… You've made a lot of progress, great job!
